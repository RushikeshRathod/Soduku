# Sudoku-Solver
This is a Sudoku solving program repository. It contains a set of programs that can successfully solve a Sudoku provided that the solution exists. Each program implements a different algorithm with different time complexities. A input file is also included to test for the potential inputs.
 Time complexity analysis will be done here.
